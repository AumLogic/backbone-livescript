Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript- and CoffeeScript-heavy applications by providing models key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface.

Backbone-coffee is based on Backbone 1.0.
