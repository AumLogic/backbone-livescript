# Backbone.View
# -------------

# Backbone Views are almost more convention than they are actual code. A View
# is simply a JavaScript object that represents a logical chunk of UI in the
# DOM. This might be a single item, an entire list, a sidebar or panel, or
# even the surrounding frame which wraps your whole app. Defining a chunk of
# UI as a **View** allows you to define your DOM events declaratively, without
# having to worry about render order ... and makes it easy for the view to
# react to specific changes in the state of your models.

# Options with special meaning *(e.g. model, collection, id, className)* are
# attached directly to the view.  See `viewOptions` for an exhaustive
# list.

# Creating a Backbone.View creates its initial element outside of the DOM,
# if an existing element is not provided...

# Cached regex to split keys for `delegate`.
delegateEventSplitter = /^(\S+)\s*(.*)$/

# List of view options to be merged as properties.
viewOptions = [
  'model'
  'collection'
  'el'
  'id'
  'attributes'
  'className'
  'tagName'
  'events'
