###
Backbone.History
----------------

Handles cross-browser history management, based on either
[pushState](http:#diveintohtml5.info/history.html) and real URLs, or
[onhashchange](https:#developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onhashchange)
and URL fragments. If the browser supports neither (old IE, natch),
falls back to polling.
